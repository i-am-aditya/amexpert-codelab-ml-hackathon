Tools and Technologies used - Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

**Important**

The detailed approach along with the conclusion is available in the .ipynb file
named "Notebook.ipynb". 


ML Algorithms used:

1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest
3) Gradient Boosting Classifier

Feature Engineering:

1) Missing values in categorical columns were filled with the mode of those columns.
2) Categorical columns were encoded using Label Encoding.
3) Missing values in other columns were filled using Median Imputation as 2 of 
   those columns had skewed distributions.
4) The "gender" column has one value - "XNA". This was replaced with the Mode of the
   column.


Performance Metric used (as per the challenge): Macro-F1
